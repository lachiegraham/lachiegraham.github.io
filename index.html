  <h1>GREGS</h1>
  <h5>a short film competition</h5>
</div>


<div class="mainText">
  <p>
    You are hereby invited to participate in the GREGS film festival, by creating a short film with a 2-5 minute recommended length (and a maximum length of 10 minutes) to be shown at the GREGS award ceremony and movie premiere.
    <br>
    <br>
    Participants will be provided with a set of guidelines for their films, and a period of two weeks to create their masterpieces. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Filmmakers and actors may produce/appear in multiple entries within the filming period to be viewed at a black tie movie screening event. 
    </p>

  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Timeline</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Filming may begin when the themes are announced, February 15th. Films are due February 28th at 11:59pm.
      <br> This gives you two weeks to do all script writing, filming, and editing required for your film. Use your time wisely :)
    </p>
  </div>

  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Rules</button>
  <div class="content">
    <br>
    <li>Teams are decided by you</li>
      <li>Teams can be of any size</li>
      <li>You may submit multiple entries</li>
      <li>Film can be any genre, so long as it is suitably short-film-like and fits the themes provided</li>
      <li>Films must not exceed 10 mins in length</li>
      <li>We recommend a length of roughly 3-5 mins</li>
      <br>
  </div>

  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Marking criteria/awards</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>To be released when the themes are announced, but here are
      a few possible award categories:</p>
      <li>award idea 1</li>
      <li>award idea 2</li>
      <li>etc</li>
      <p>Trophies will be supplied to winners of the various categories of awards, with judging being carried out by all participants during the GREGS award ceremony (everyone gets to vote).</p>
  </div>

  <button type="button" class="collapsible">What if I'm not in Canberra?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Good news! We have a prize for the best foreign film (i.e. film not made in Canberra) so you can still participate!
      <br> <br> So find some people to make a film with, or do it by yourself. Good luck :) </p>
  </div>

  <button type="button" class="collapsible">I'm really busy right now. Can't we do this some other time?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>This whole thing is just for fun, so it's ok if you don't make something worthy of Sundance. So just make something a little bit silly and have fun with it!
      <br><br> If time is really a concern for you, we suggest you pick a role that won't be too time consuming.
      <br> For example, volunteering to be an actor in films that others have written probably won't take more than a few hours out of your day.
      <br> On the flip side, editing can be a long and tedious task, so only volunteer for this if you're schedule is sufficiently empty :)
    </p>
  </div>

  <button type="button" class="collapsible">I have a question that wasn't answered by the FAQ</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Send one of the hosts a text! Use this handy-dandy table to decide who to message based on what day it is!
       <br> <br>Monday: Spike <br> Tuesday: Isi <br> Wednesday: Graham <br>
       Thursday: Spike <br> Friday: Isi <br> Saturday: Graham <br>
       Sunday: Roll a D6. If it’s a multiple of 3 text Graham. If not, but it’s a multiple of 2, text Isi. Otherwise, text spike.
