Good evening esteemed filmmakers, actors, and company. 
We write today to inform you of an upcoming event to take place this February, initiating on the 15th of February, followed by a gathering on the 1st of March. 
<br>
You are hereby invited to participate in the GREGS film festival, by creating a short film with a 2-5 minute recommended length (and a maximum length of 10 minutes) to be shown at the GREGS award ceremony and movie premiere. Participants will be provided with a set of guidelines for their films, and a period of two weeks to create their masterpieces. 
<br>
Filmmakers and actors may produce/appear in multiple entries within the filming period to be viewed at a black tie movie screening event. 
<br>
Trophies will be supplied to winners of the various categories of awards, with judging being carried out by participants during the GREGS award ceremony. 
As an optional component, participants may choose to design a movie poster for their film to be emailed to Isi and displayed on the night. A poster design category will be included in the ceremony.
